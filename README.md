SOB - State Of Being

This is a little program I've written for myself.

It collects levels of happiness, energy and focus on hourly level. Data is saved to Excel spreadsheed (sheet.xlsx).

<b>Options</b>
  1. -a --show-month-averages [path_to_file sheetName] => Create new spreadsheet in current folder.
  2. -c --create-spreadsheet [fileName] => Shows averages for selected month (sheet).
