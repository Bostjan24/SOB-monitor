SOB - State Of Being

This is a little program I've written for myself. Fell free to use it.

It collects levels of happiness, energy and focus on hourly level. Data is saved to Excel spreadsheed (SOBm-data.xlsx).

You can choose whether you would save data to a spreadsheet or to the database.

<b>Saving data to spreadsheet</b>

When you run the program for the first time, you need to run it with create spreadsheet option (see below), to create an empty spreadsheet. Spreadsheet will be created in the same folder where program is located.

<b>Saving data to the database</b>



<b>Options</b>
  1. -a, --show-month-averages [sheet_name] => Shows averages for selected sheet.
  2. -c, --create-spreadsheet => Creates spreadsheet named SOBm-data.xlsx in current folder
